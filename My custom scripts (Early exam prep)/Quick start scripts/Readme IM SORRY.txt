Sorry for the extremely dull looooong explainations in each in order for me to pass the exam i had to also explain what each script was doing in very tedius and lengthy terms because otherwise i couldnt use my scripts thats also why theres a broken down py script comps folder so i could section them and explain 
them in detail if i needed to
